## Coding and coffee

to me... go hand in hand. And since its a recurring practice why not dial it the execution. Today Im going to write about the aero press and how one can get the optimal coffee expereince.

## History

The Aeropress is a coffee brewing device invented by [Alan Adler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Adler), an American inventor and aerodynamics expert, in 2005. Adler was an avid coffee lover and was dissatisfied with the taste and quality of the coffee he brewed at home. He set out to create a coffee maker that was simple to use, easy to clean, and produced high-quality coffee.

After several years of experimentation, Adler developed the Aeropress, a unique coffee maker that uses air pressure to extract the full flavor from coffee grounds. The Aeropress consists of a plastic chamber with a metal filter, a rubber plunger, and a coffee scoop. To brew coffee, the user places a filter in the chamber, adds coffee grounds and hot water, stirs, and then presses the plunger down to extract the coffee. The whole process takes just a few minutes and produces a rich, smooth, and full-bodied cup of coffee.

The Aeropress quickly gained popularity among coffee enthusiasts, who praised its simplicity and the high quality of the coffee it produced. Adler and his company, Aerobie, began manufacturing and selling the Aeropress worldwide, and it has become a popular choice for home coffee brewing. In recent years, the Aeropress has also gained popularity among professional baristas and coffee shops, who use it to brew specialty coffee drinks and compete in the World Aeropress Championship.

Overall, the Aeropress is a unique and innovative coffee brewing device that has revolutionized the way people brew coffee at home and in cafes. Its simplicity and high-quality results have made it a favorite among coffee lovers around the world.

## How to get delicious coffee from an aero press

There are many ways to make delicious coffee using an AeroPress. Some people prefer to use a medium-fine grind, while others like a finer grind. Generally, it is best to experiment and find the method that works best for your taste preferences.
To make coffee with an AeroPress, follow these steps:

1. Heat water to about 205 degrees Fahrenheit (96 degrees Celsius).
2. Grind your coffee beans to a medium-fine grind.
3. Place a filter in the AeroPress filter cap and moisten it with some hot water. This will help to remove any paper taste from the filter.
4. Place the AeroPress on a mug or cup and add the ground coffee.
5. Slowly pour the hot water over the coffee, making sure to wet all of the grounds.
6. Stir the mixture for about 10-20 seconds, then place the plunger on top of the AeroPress and gently press down to brew the coffee.
7. Once the coffee has been brewed, remove the plunger and dispose of the spent coffee grounds.
8. Enjoy your delicious cup of coffee!
9. Remember, the key to making delicious coffee with an AeroPress is to experiment and find the method that works best for your taste preferences.

## What if we want it more like expresso

If you want to make espresso-style coffee with an AeroPress, you can use a finer grind and increase the pressure when pressing the plunger. This will extract more flavor from the coffee and create a thicker, more concentrated brew.

## Timing

The exact amount of time you should wait after pouring the water into the Aeropress before pressing it depends on the specific brewing method you are using. However, most brewing methods recommend waiting for 30 seconds to 1 minute after pouring the water before pressing the plunger down.

One popular brewing method, known as the inverted method, involves flipping the Aeropress upside down and placing it on top of a mug. After pouring the water into the chamber and adding the coffee grounds, the user waits for 30 seconds to 1 minute before pressing the plunger down. This allows the coffee grounds to fully bloom and release their flavors into the water before the extraction process begins.

Another popular brewing method, known as the standard method, involves placing the Aeropress on top of a mug with the plunger facing upwards. After pouring the water into the chamber and adding the coffee grounds, the user waits for 30 seconds to 1 minute before pressing the plunger down. This allows the coffee grounds to fully bloom and release their flavors into the water before the extraction process begins.

Overall, the exact amount of time you should wait after pouring the water into the Aeropress before pressing it depends on the brewing method you are using and your personal preferences. Experiment with different brewing methods and timings to find the one that produces the best results for your taste.

## Aeropress in the Woods

Here are some tips for using an AeroPress while camping:

1. Use a camping stove or portable gas burner to heat the water for your coffee.
2. Bring pre-ground coffee or a portable coffee grinder so you can grind your own beans on-site.
3. If you are using a camping stove, make sure to use a stable, heat-resistant surface to prevent the AeroPress from tipping over.
4. Bring a mug or cup to brew your coffee into, as well as a spoon or stirrer to mix the coffee and water.
5. Consider bringing a portable milk frother if you like to add milk or creamer to your coffee.
6. Remember to pack the AeroPress plunger and filter cap, as well as filters, in a separate bag to prevent them from getting lost or damaged.
7. Be sure to clean the AeroPress thoroughly after each use to prevent the buildup of coffee grounds and oils.

By following these tips, you can enjoy delicious coffee from your AeroPress while camping. Happy brewing!

## Where did expresso originate?

Espresso is a type of coffee that originated in Italy. The name "espresso" comes from the Italian word "espresso," which means "pressed out" or "forced out." This refers to the method of brewing espresso, in which hot water is forced through finely ground coffee beans under high pressure to extract the flavor.
The history of espresso can be traced back to the early 1900s in Italy, when a new type of coffee machine was developed that could brew coffee quickly and efficiently using steam pressure. This machine, called the espresso machine, allowed for the creation of a new type of coffee called espresso.
Espresso quickly became popular in Italy and eventually spread to other parts of Europe and the world. Today, it is enjoyed in cafes and coffee shops all over the globe and is a staple of Italian cuisine.

## Just for fun...What are the origins of coffee?

The exact origins of coffee drinking are not well-known, but it is believed that people have been consuming coffee for at least 500 years. The first known evidence of coffee drinking comes from the 15th century, when coffee was consumed in the Sufi monasteries of Yemen.
According to legend, coffee was discovered by a goatherder named Kaldi, who noticed that his goats became more energetic and alert after eating the berries from a certain tree. Kaldi tried the berries himself and found that they had a similar effect on him. He shared the berries with the monks at a nearby monastery, who brewed a drink from the berries and found that it kept them awake and alert during their long hours of prayer.
From Yemen, the use of coffee spread to other parts of the Middle East and eventually to Europe and the Americas. Today, coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world, consumed by millions of people every day. [source](https://www.ncausa.org/about-coffee/history-of-coffee)
