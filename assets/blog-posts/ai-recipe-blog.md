## AI Daily Recipe Blog

Today's thought experiment will be about an AI blog that requests information from an OpenAi GPT and writes daily recipe articles. I am imagining a lively voice that speaks about its sources and conveys an excitement for cooking. Our Ai friend writes clear concise recipes with minimal fluff.

### What sets this aside from other blogs?

The idea is to have an AI create new unique recipes from the information stored in books. Obviously the recipes must be delicious. The current form of the idea has no one cooking the recipes before being posted which invites a fair bit of risk.. or maybe excitement?

The custom GPT would be built upon cooking books that I pick out by hand and will need to be continually fed new information in order to stay interesting and unique for extended periods of time.

## Challenges and Considerations

- Recipe Validation: Without pre-testing, some recipes might be impractical or inedible.
- User Feedback Mechanism: Implementing a way for users to provide feedback on recipes can help improve the AI model.
- Cost Management: Continuous API calls to OpenAI and cloud hosting can incur significant costs.
- Ethical and Legal Considerations: Ensuring that the AI does not inadvertently plagiarize or create culturally insensitive content.

## Unique Selling Points

- Consistent and Quality Content Creation: Utilizing AI, this project can generate imaginative recipes that are clear descriptive, concise and regularly published without the need for a human to write.
- Innovation in Recipes: With access to a vast database of culinary books, the AI can combine ingredients and techniques in novel ways, potentially creating unique and delicious recipes.
- Risk and Excitement Factor: Since recipes aren't tested before posting, there's an element of surprise and experimentation for the readers.

## Total estimated time and cost

Approximately 1,800 hours or 45 weeks. This estimate is based on an average work week of 40 hours and the time allocations provided for each task. Actual hours may vary based on team efficiency, unforeseen challenges, and project scope adjustments.

To estimate the cost of AWS bills for the project over its 45-week timeline, we need to consider several factors. AWS pricing is complex and varies based on the services used, the scale of those services, and the region in which they are deployed. For a project like an AI-driven recipe blog, the following AWS services might be utilized:

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): For running servers.
RDS (Relational Database Service): For the PostgreSQL database.
S3 (Simple Storage Service): For storing static files like images.
Route 53: For DNS and domain management.
Elastic Load Balancing: To distribute traffic.
Lambda: For serverless functions.
CloudFront: For content delivery network services.
AWS Support Plan: For technical support.

### Assuming a moderate usage scenario for a medium-traffic blog, let's make some ballpark estimates:

EC2: A t3.medium instance for 24/7 operation might cost around $70/month.
RDS: A db.t3.medium instance, roughly $100/month.
S3: Costs depend heavily on usage but let's estimate $30/month for moderate usage.
Route 53: Around $1/month for domain management, plus a small charge per DNS query.
Elastic Load Balancing: Around $20/month assuming moderate traffic.
Lambda: Charges are per-request and compute time, but for moderate usage, let's estimate $20/month.
CloudFront: Costs vary, but for moderate traffic, let's estimate $50/month.
AWS Support Plan: The "Developer" plan is $29/month.
Now, let's calculate the total estimated monthly cost and then extend it to the project timeline of 45 weeks:

## Total Monthly Cost

A minimal setup with a small to medium-sized EC2 instance, a corresponding RDS instance, and moderate use of S3 might cost around $100 to $200 per month. However, this is a very rough estimate and can vary significantly.

The estimated AWS cost for supporting the AI-driven recipe blog over a 45-week period could range from approximately $1,038 to $2,077.

## What if there is no traffic?

In this scenario, the cost would likely skew towards the lower end of the previously estimated range ($100 per month) or even less, as you wouldn't need a highly capable infrastructure for handling traffic. However, some costs, like those for database storage and minimal server requirements, remain unavoidable.

Let's recalculate the total cost for a 45-week duration with a lower monthly estimate, assuming minimal traffic-related expenses.

With no traffic, the estimated AWS cost for supporting the AI-driven recipe blog over a 45-week period would be approximately $1,038.

## Do I actually think this is viable?

There is a large concern around actual quality of recipes that are generated. Lots of testing will have to happen before this is a viable product. I think that the idea is interesting and could be a fun project to work on. I am not sure if it is a viable business idea. Instead of developing this out as we have discussed, testing recipe generation by the custom GPT and seeing if they are quality will be a real eye opener.

Maybe I will give testing the custom recipe GPT a try! I do not see myself investing a year of life into this project although I do think it would be fun to work on.
