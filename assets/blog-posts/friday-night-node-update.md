It's Friday evening and part of me wants to be out meeting people and having fun but my recurring desire to adventure out for social interaction rarely matches up with my ideal. So I am home thinking about how I can improve my personal blog website and aiming for a good nights rest. I love how I can build tools that serve a personal use case such as building a website to process my thoughts and learn more about technology.

The articles I've written so far they are mostly thought experiments about how I would plan and execute a technical project. I believe I enjoy this because I can experience possibilities without having to invest the time to actually required to see the end result. I go through the steps and place myself at the end of the projects timeline, imagine the potential problems, and reflect. This could be applied to running a business, planning a website, or cooking a meal.

A new style of writing could be something called a technical reflection. (working title) Simply a journal of an experience building or solving a problem. Testing the idea below.

Technical Reflection:I am doing website maintenance on a few personal domains I have had hosted for some time. I would like to shut down one react project and move my next.js project under the react project's domain. Additionally the Nextx.js project has not been touched in about a year so updates and changes are inevitable.

I needed to transfer content on website 'A' to domain 'B' and take down the current content being served by domain B. I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of pain. The first few times setting up DNS records was not intuitive but now having done it a few times its not as intimidating.

I needed to update my computer's node version so that I could update the Next.js and subsequently start to use material UI. The joy of updates, always one thing leading to another. I want to use MUI's grid component because I'm tired of setting max width values for things while trying to get responsive screens to work on everything from Mobile to a big desktop screen. The more time I spend programming the happier I am too assign some complexity to a popular solution.

Updating my node version and packages has never been something I looked forward to. I was happy to find that I was able to use NVM to install the recommended version of node without an issue.

The thought of not being stressed out by breaking something is a nice change of pace. The next task on my list is to create a resume page, about page,  and post this blog.

I'm excited to see where the thought experiments go.
