There are many ways to create an online ordering menu, and the best approach will depend on your specific needs and preferences. This implementation will use a variety of SaaS tools to create a fully functional online ordering menu that can be used by customers to place orders and pay for them online.

## What are the options?

### Using a website builder platform

Many website builder platforms, such as Wix, Weebly, and Squarespace, offer tools and features that make it easy to create an online ordering menu. These platforms typically provide customizable templates and drag-and-drop editors that allow users to create and design their menus without the need for coding knowledge.

### Using an online ordering system

There are also many online ordering systems, such as Square, ChowNow, and Grubhub, that allow businesses to create and manage their online ordering menus. These systems often provide additional features, such as the ability to accept online payments and manage orders and customer information.

### Using a form builder

Form builder platforms, such as JotForm, offer tools and features that can be used to create online ordering menus. These platforms typically allow users to create custom forms that can be used to collect information from customers, such as their order details and contact information.

In general, the best way to create an online ordering menu will depend on your specific needs and preferences. It may be helpful to compare different options and consider factors such as cost, ease of use, and the features and tools offered by each platform before making a decision.

### What is Jotform?

JotForm is an online platform that allows users to create and publish web-based forms. It provides a wide range of tools and features that make it easy to create and customize forms for a variety of purposes, such as surveys, polls, order forms, and more. JotForm also offers integrations with other platforms and services, such as payment processors, email marketing tools, and social media networks, to help users collect and manage their data more efficiently.

To create an online food menu using JotForm, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a JotForm account, if you don't already have one.
2. Click on the "Create Form" button to start a new form.
3. Choose a template or start from scratch to design your food menu form.
4. Add fields to your form to collect information from customers, such as their name, contact information, and the items they would like to order.
5. Use the customization options in JotForm to design and format your form, including adding images and text to showcase your food items and prices.
6. Publish your form by clicking on the "Publish" button and selecting the desired method, such as embedding the form on your website or creating a link that can be shared on social media or in emails.
7. Test your form to make sure it is working properly and collecting the information you need.
8. Monitor and manage the orders received through your form by logging in to your JotForm account and viewing the collected data.
9. Keep in mind that while JotForm can be used to create an online food menu, it may not provide all the features and tools necessary to manage and process orders. You may want to consider using a dedicated online ordering system or website builder platform to create a more comprehensive online ordering experience for your customers.

### JotForm offers a variety of ways to integrate its forms into websites, including the following

- Embedding: JotForm allows users to easily embed their forms into their website using an HTML code snippet or WordPress plugin. This allows the form to appear directly on the website, and any data collected through the form will be automatically added to the user's JotForm account.
- Pop-ups: JotForm also offers a pop-up option, which allows users to display their forms as a pop-up window on their website. This can be useful for capturing leads or gathering feedback from website visitors without requiring them to navigate away from the page they are currently viewing.
- Links: JotForm users can also create links to their forms, which can be shared on social media, in emails, or on other websites. This allows users to direct people to their forms without requiring them to embed the form directly on their website.
- In addition to these options, JotForm also offers integrations with many popular website builder platforms, such as Wix, Weebly, and Squarespace, which make it easy to add JotForm forms to these types of websites.

### What is Zapier? How can we use it?

Zapier is a platform that allows users to connect different web-based applications and services, including JotForm, to automate tasks and streamline their workflow. To use Zapier to connect your JotForm form to email alerts for your business, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a JotForm form that collects the information you need for your business, such as customer inquiries, orders, or feedback.
2. Sign up for a Zapier account and log in to the Zapier dashboard.
3. Click on the "Make a Zap" button to create a new automation, or "Zap."
4. Select JotForm as the trigger application, which is the application that will initiate the automation. For example, you can choose "New Submission" as the trigger event, which will trigger the automation whenever someone submits your form.
5. Choose your JotForm account and select the form you want to use for the automation.
6. Test the trigger to make sure it is working properly and fetching the information you need from your form.
7. Select the action application, which is the application that will perform the desired action in response to the trigger event. In this case, you can choose an email provider, such as Gmail or Outlook, as the action application.
8. Configure the action settings, such as the email address you want to use to send the alerts, the subject and body of the email, and any other relevant details. You can also use dynamic data from your JotForm form, such as the customer's name or order details, in the email by using Zapier's placeholders.
9. Test the action to make sure it is working properly and sending the email alerts as expected.
10. Turn on your Zap and it will automatically run whenever someone submits your JotForm form.

By using Zapier to connect your JotForm form to email alerts, you can automate this process and receive instant notifications whenever someone submits your form. This can help you stay informed about your business and respond to customer inquiries and orders more efficiently.

### How can we connect jotform to a bank account and set up automatic deposits?

JotForm does not have a direct integration with bank accounts for automatic deposits. However, you can use JotForm in combination with a payment processor, such as PayPal or Stripe, to accept online payments and transfer the funds to your bank account.

To connect JotForm to a bank account with automatic deposits, you can follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a JotForm account and create a form that allows customers to make payments, such as an order form or donation form.
2. Sign up for a payment processor account, such as PayPal or Stripe.
3. In your JotForm account, click on the "Payments" tab and select the payment processor you want to use.
4. Follow the instructions to connect your payment processor account to JotForm. This may involve providing your payment processor API keys or other authentication details.
5. Add a payment field to your JotForm form and select the payment processor as the payment method.
6. Configure the payment field settings, such as the currency and payment options, and customize the appearance of the payment field on your form.
7. Publish your form and test it to make sure it is working properly and accepting payments.
8. In your payment processor account, set up automatic deposits to transfer the funds from your payment processor account to your bank account.
9. Keep in mind that payment processors may have their own fees and requirements for transferring funds to bank accounts. It is important to review and understand these fees and requirements before using a payment processor to connect JotForm to your bank account.

### Conclusion

This is the basic overview of Jotform and how it can be used to create an online food menu. Jotform is a great tool for creating online forms and collecting data. However, it may not be the best option for managing and processing orders. If you want to create a more comprehensive online ordering experience for your customers, you may want to consider using a dedicated online ordering system or website builder platform. I believe the major advantage of this solution is that it can be done with minimum coding knowledge and limited time.

### Bonus Idea - Email users who partially filled out the form

JotForm allows users to send emails to people who have started filling out a form but have not completed it, also known as form abandonment. This can be useful for reminding people to complete the form or providing additional information that may be relevant to their decision-making process.

To send emails to users who abandon a form, you can follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a JotForm account and create a form that you want to use for this purpose.
2. In your JotForm account, click on the "Emails" tab and select the "Form Abandonment" option.
3. Enable the form abandonment email by clicking on the "Activate" button.
4. Use the email builder to create and customize the form abandonment email, including the sender and recipient information, subject and body of the email, and any other relevant details. You can also use dynamic data from the form, such as the person's name or the fields they have already filled out, in the email by using JotForm's placeholders.
5. Test the email to make sure it is working properly and sending as expected.
6. Save and activate the email, and it will automatically be sent to users who abandon the form after a certain amount of time, which you can specify in the email settings.

By using JotForm's form abandonment email feature, you can remind people to complete your form and provide them with additional information that may be relevant to their decision-making process. This can help increase the completion rate of your forms and improve the overall user experience.
