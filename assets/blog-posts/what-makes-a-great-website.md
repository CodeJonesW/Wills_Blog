## Intro

- When a website is well crafted, it displays what you have to offer, creates a connection, communicates trust. My goal is to write about the core concepts that are used by well designed user experiences all over the web. There are many layers that can be applied on top of the core elements to spice things up but always on a foundation of well executed principles.

## Mobile First Design

- In a world where mobile devices are the primary way people access the internet it is important to make sure your website is optimized for mobile devices. This is not to say that desktop users should be ignored but it is important to make sure the mobile experience is as good as it can be. The idea is to design the mobile experience first and then expand it to desktop. This is great way to build a website overtime and continue to add features.

## Use a style guide to start

- This advice will say you a ton of time when you are starting a new site. It is a great way to get a head start on the design process. I have found a style guide for a webflow site that you can use as a starting point for your next project. [Style guide](https://webflow.com/website/Style-Guide)

- It will allow us to implement a component based system and reduce complex changes.

- Below are great sources of inspiration. Opening various projects templates in webflow can give one an idea of how such things were built.

## Visibility

- When desiging a website a it is crucial to make sure your users can clearly see and understand what elements are on the page. Selecting a color pallete can be difficult if you have not spent time thinking about the topic previously. Greate color selections are not random but carely calculated for a harmonious visual experience. The Material Design [color system](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-usage-and-palettes) is a great resource to help improve your understanding as well a generate [colors palletes](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors)

- It is surprising how easy it is for users to become confused when navigating a website. Clear call to action buttons are a must. For the simplest of implementations 2 styles of buttons can be used to distinguish between primary and secondary actions.
- The goal is to tell a story and allow your user to experience it in a frictionless glide allowing the information to clearly be communicated beteen both entities. Creating a user flow that provides more information in every step while offering a way to take action at some point is a relatively standard way to draw in users across the web. Some websites will take you all the way through the information on a page and then present a single action button others will present it throughout the sections of the page.

## Custom Content

- It is also known that creating custom content for your website creates more trust between you and your users while also increasing SEO rankings. SEO is a topic that is beyond the scope of this article but it is important to understand that the more content you have the more likely you are to be found by users searching for your topic. This is a great way to build a community around your website and create a place where people can come to learn about your topic.

## Great photos

- Undeniably great photos add a lot of extra flavor to a website. Taking a few great photos for your brand and proper editing can go a long way. Removing the background from the central visual element of a photo is an easy way to create an effect. Remove background tools like [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/) make it easy. Alternatively acquiring a photo editor like [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) is an option for those looking for a deeper dive. Gimp is fairly complicated similar to photoshop but is open source and free.

## Keeping it simple

- WIth all these things in mind some times it can be easy to put to much paint on the canvas. Sticking to the main points you are trying to make can havea major impact as well.
