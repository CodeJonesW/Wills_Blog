# What makes a great website?

## Intro

- My goal is to write about the core concepts of website design implemented widely across the internet. There are many layers that can be applied on top of the core elements to spice things up but always on a foundation of well executed principles.

## Visibility

- When desiging a website a it is crucial to make sure your users can clearly see and understand what elements are on the page. Selecting a color pallete can be difficult if you have not spent time thinking about the topic previously. Greate color selections are not random but carely calculated for a harmonious visual experience. The Material Design [color system](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-usage-and-palettes) is a great resource to help improve your understanding as well a generate [colors palletes](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors)

- It is surprising how easy it is for users to become confused when navigating a website. Clear call to action buttons are a must. For the simplest of implementations 2 styles of buttons can be used to distinguish between primary and secondary actions.
- The goal is to tell a story and allow your user to experience it in a frictionless glide allowing the information to clearly be communicated beteen both entities. Creating a user flow that provides more information in every step while offering a way to take action at some point is a relatively standard way to draw in users across the web. Some websites will take you all the way through the information on a page and then present a single action button others will present it throughout the sections of the page.

## Great photos

- Undeniably greate photos add a lot of extra flavor to a website. Taking a few great photos for your brand and proper editing can go a long way. Removing the background from the central visual element of a photo is an easy way to create an effect. Remove background tools like [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/) make it easy. Alternatively acquiring a photo editor like [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) is an option for those looking for a deeper dive. Gimp is fairly complicated similar to photoshop but is open source and free.

## Keeping it simple

WIth all these things in mind some times it can be easy to put to much paint on the canvas. Sticking to the main points you are trying to make can havea major impact as well.
