## The Job Market in 2024

Today it seems evident that getting a job in software engineering is not as easy as it may have been in 2019. In the year of 2024, the combination of AI and remote work has made it difficult to get attention when applying to jobs. While scanning the internet for available positions there appears to be no shortage of job postings for frontend developers, backend developers, and full-stack developers. However anyone from anywhere can now apply which makes it equally difficult for hiring managers to sift through the applications as it is for the applicants to get noticed.
